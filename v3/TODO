Memo
----

- Cache scalar expressions that do not contain subqueries.

- Figure out a way to reuse the cursor memory. One challenge is that
  transformations can hold on to cursors across calls to bind. Perhaps
  we can add an API where we start a bind iteration has an associated
  arena to allocate from and when the iteration ends we bulk free all
  of the expressions. We'd also want to use this arena for the
  expressions created by the transformation.

Prep
----

- Add column numbering pass instead of performing column numbering
  during build().

- More extensive scalar expression normalization.

Properties
----------

- Add planProperties which contains an ordering specification.

- Compute keys for relational expressions.

- Add check for null intolerant filters.

Search
------

- Add optimization context which specifies required plan properties.

- Internalize the following from the Cascades paper:

  A group is explored using transformation rules only on demand, and
  it is explored only to create members of the group that match a
  given pattern. Thus exploring a group or an expression means
  deriving all logical expressions that match a given pattern. The
  pattern, which is part of the task definition, is a sub-tree of the
  rule's antecedent or "before" pattern.

Stats
-----

- Calculate selectivity using histograms and filters.

- Propagate selectivity from scans up through relational operators.

Testing
-------

- Add html output that allows stepping through memo search.

- Add facility for testing expression binding. Probably add something
  to logic-test like "bind:x.y" which means iterate through all of the
  bindings at memo location x.y and output the resulting
  `expr.MemoString()`.

- Verify that computing the logical properties for a transformed
  expression results in the same properties as the originating
  expression. That is, transformations only create logically
  equivalent expressions.

- Use a query and associated schema to create random table data that
  tickles various problematic conditions in the query. For example,
  various possibilities for duplicate values (no duplicates, 1
  duplicate, many duplicates) and the various possibilities for
  NULL-able columns. This would essentially be a walk over the query
  tree looking for interesting nodes and recording variations in the
  table data to generate.

Transformations
---------------

- Distinct/group-by elimination. If the grouping columns are a key
  from the input, we don't need to perform the grouping.

- Group-by pull-up. Pull group-by above a join.

- Group-by push-down. Push group-by below a join.

- Convert decorrelation to be a regular transformation.

- Convert push-down to be a regular transformation. Is there a
  separate push-down transformation per relational expression? This is
  yet another argument in favor of a selectOp.

- Experiment with a transformation language.

- Allow transforms to specify their compatibility with other
  transforms. Memo expressions can store which transformation created
  them which allows skipping transforms. For example, the join
  commutativity transform is not applied to an expression that was
  created by the join commutatitivity transform.
