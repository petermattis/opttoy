// # Optimization
// Memo groups are recursively optimized according to a set of required
// physical properties. The same group can be (and sometimes is) optimized
// multiple times with different required props. Optimization of a group
// proceeds in two phases:
//
// 1. Compute the cost of any previously generated expressions. That set
//    initially contains only the group's normalized expression, but
//    exploration may yield additional expressions. Costing a parent expression
//    requires that the children first be costed, so costing triggers a
//    recursive traversal of the memo groups.
//
// 2. Invoke the explorer to generate new equivalent expressions for the group.
//    Those new expressions are costed once the optimizer loops back to the
//    first phase.
//
// # Search Algorithm
// The optimizer proceeds in multiple iterative "passes", until either it hits
// some configured limit, or until an exhaustive search is complete. As long as
// the search is allowed to complete, the best plan will be found, just as in
// Volcano and Cascades. The optimizer uses several techniques to maximize the
// chance that it finds the best plan early on:
//
// 1. As with Cascades, the search is highly directed, interleaving exploration
//    with costing in order to prune parts of the tree that cannot yield a
//    better plan. This contrasts with Volcano, which first generates all
//    possible plans in one global phase (exploration), and then determines the
//    lowest cost plan in another global phase (costing).
//
// 2. The optimizer uses a simple hill climbing heuristic to make greedy
//    progress towards the best plan. During a given pass, the optimizer visits
//    each group and performs costing and exploration for that group. As long
//    as doing that yields a lower cost expression for the group, the optimizer
//    will repeat those steps. This finds a local maxima for each group during
//    the current pass.
//
// # Search Space Pruning
// In order to avoid costing or exploring parts of the search space that cannot
// yield a better plan, the optimizer performs aggressive "branch and bound
// pruning". Each group expression is optimized with respect to a "costLimit"
// parameter. As soon as this limit is exceeded, optimization of that
// expression terminates. It's not uncommon for large sections of the search
// space to never be costed or explored due to this pruning. Example:
//
//   innerJoin
//     left:  cost = 50
//     right: cost = 75
//     on:    cost = 25
//
// If the current best expression for the group has a cost of 100, then the
// optimizer does not need to cost or explore the "on" child of the join, and
// does not need to cost the join itself. This is because the combined cost of
// the left and right children already exceeds 100.
